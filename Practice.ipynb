    "\n",
    "When you encounter the error `push declined due to repository rule violations`, it typically means that the repository has some rules or protections in place that prevent certain types of changes from being pushed directly to the `master` branch. Here are some steps to resolve this issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check Branch Protection Rules**:\n",
    "    - Go to the repository on GitHub.\n",
    "    - Navigate to `Settings` > `Branches`.\n",
    "    - Check if there are any branch protection rules set for the `master` branch. These rules might require pull requests, code reviews, or status checks before changes can be merged.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a New Branch**:\n",
    "    - Instead of pushing directly to the `master` branch, create a new branch for your changes.\n",
    "    - Use the following commands to create a new branch and push your changes:\n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      git checkout -b new-branch-name\n",
    "      git add .\n",
    "      git commit -m \"Your commit message\"\n",
    "      git push origin new-branch-name\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Open a Pull Request**:\n",
    "    - After pushing your changes to the new branch, go to the repository on GitHub.\n",
    "    - Open a pull request from your new branch to the `master` branch.\n",
    "    - Follow any required steps such as code reviews or status checks to get your pull request merged.\n",
