# ðŸš€ RAG & LangChain Exploration

Welcome to the **RAG & LangChain Exploration** repository! This project is a hands-on deep dive into **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **LangChain**, **Langsmith** ,**LangServe**, and **LangGraph**covering fundamental and advanced concepts through interactive Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This repository consists of a structured learning path covering key concepts such as interacting with LLMs, RAG fundamentals, LangChain Expression Language (LCEL), memory management, and deploying models with LangServe and concepts related to Agents and Multi-Agents
