The employers of Software Engineers cover \\nstartup companies to established industry leaders.  \\n \\nDue to the emerging use of the internet, e -mail, communications systems, firms from electronics to \\nengineering as they are traditionally associated with unrelated disciplines, which in turn, allows the \\nsoftware engineers to hire more and more in engineering firms specializing in building bridges and power \\nplants. For example, software engineers are designated in designing and developing advanced geographic \\ndata systems and automated drafting systems. Communication industries also require software engineers, \\nwhich indeed help the personal communications market as well. The major communications companies \\nhave many job opportunities for both software engineers and computer systems engineers. A growing \\nnumber of Software Engineers are also employed on a temporary or contract basis (with many being self -\\nemployed) who work on their own as consultants. Some of these consultants work for firms that specialize \\nin the development and maintenance of Web sites and intranets of client companies.  \\n \\nA Software Engi neering Degree will also open doors for careers in Research, Software Development,  \\nand Business analysis with companies such as Microsoft, Oracle, Systems Limited, Hewlett Packard \\nEnterprise, and IBM.  \\n \\nBy getting a degree in Software Engineering, graduates  can work in any number of fields creating \\nVideo Games, developing Internet Applications, running Computer Networks, or implementing \\nComputer Security measures for an organization.  \\n \\nCareer opportunities are not limited to technology. The problem -solving, i nnovative, and personal \\nskills you learn in this course will be sought after in many organizations.'),\n",
